# Naval Wars

## How to Run

Go into the frontend folder, run `npm i` and then `npm run dev`.

## To Do

##### Bugs

- Updating user data fails in certain places due to caching (navigation bar, leaving page then coming back to it)
  - Solution: Something async when loading data

##### Clean up

- fix: there are duplicate environment variables for the database URL
- should I add ID or email as userID?

##### Project

- ~~Implement cookie sessions~~
- ~~Create user upon first login~~
- Clean up and make components modular
- Protect pages when user isn't logged in
- Add ability to change profile picture
- Finish the character component so that it loads characters from the server
